                    Hi! My name is Nuohan Li, I am from Montreal, Quebec. I am currently a freshman at University of Waterloo in Computer Engineering.
                I have quite a bit of experience of working as a technician, troubleshooting various issues for over 1350 Dollarama stores across
                Canada in both English and French. Not only this honed my language skills, but also the skill to find and solve problems. Beside this
                I am also able to write programs in Java/JavaFX and C++. I am also self learning Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript to further improve 
                my skills.
                </p>
                
                <h1>A bit more</h1>
                
                <p>
                    Unlike most of my classmates who are still in their teens, I am already in early twenties. I wanted to take some time off after high school to work because I didn't really know what I wanted to do 
                with my life, but due to pressure from my parents, I applied to CEGEP (junior college that is exclusive to Quebec) in Computer Science Technology,
                a three year career program that does not prepare students for university but for work. Admittedly, I was not motivated at all hence having very
                average grade, and was not really learning anything, until I met my former manager at work. He offered me a job as technician at Dollarama head office,
                through the job, I had chance to gain a deeper understanding of computer systems and become interested in it. That's when I decided to pick up 
                prerequisites, and applied to university.
                Though I wasted a lot of time
                </p>
