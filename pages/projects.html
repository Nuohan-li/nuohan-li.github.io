            <h1>Task Manager</h1>
            <p class="text">
                A very simple task manager with minimal front-end. This app is built using Node.JS and MongoDB. 
                The front-end is written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

                I built this tool because I used to look for a simple task managers everywhere online to no avail.
                While all the apps I found online are wonderful and feature-rich, but what I am looking for, is just a simple app that 
                gets its job done.
                Since I cannot find one online, so I thought of making one myself.

            <h1>Hacking Tools</h1>
            <p class="text">
                A suite of hacking tools focused on MITM (Man in the middle) attack. The following tools
                are included: ARP Spoofing, MAC address Changer, Network Scanner and Sniffer.

                These tools allow users to place themselves in between the target machine and the gateway,
                tricking the victim into thinking that the hacker machine is the gateway, thus send all its 
                network traffic to the hacker machine. The hacker machine can then capture all the traffic for analyzing later.
                All the tools are written in Python and Scapy module. More tools will be added, such as DNS Spoofig
                and HTTPS bypass etc.
