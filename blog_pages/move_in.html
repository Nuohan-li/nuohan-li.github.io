            <p><span id="preview"> I thought that I would like to talk a bit more about my blog here. This blog, in fact this whole website 
                is a project that I continuously worked on as I learn web development. That is why I decided to code this blog
                manually instead of using a content management system like WordExpress. </span>I originally thought that I would make
                my website a professional one, but on a second thought, it seemed more fun to make it more casual and personal
                so that I wouldn't have to worry about all the "professionalism" when I express myself. Hence this blog is born,
                as a by-product of my very first web development project. <br><br>

                I am not too sure yet what kind of contents I want to put in this blog. For now, I will upload whatever that is on
                my mind, things that I feel like sharing with other people. (Maybe mroe like twitter or an open diary than a blog).
                <br><br>

                There are almost no features as of now, if by any chance I am actually getting some people to visit this 
                blog, I would love to add a commenting system, though admittedly, that is out of my league right now. But 
                it will happen eventually.
