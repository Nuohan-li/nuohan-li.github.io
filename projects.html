            <p class="tictactoe-text">The classic game that every one has played. This is also my very first project done in Python. Pygame library is used to create
                this game. The game takes two players, each player take turn to place a cross or a circle on the available spot, until one player
                got three of her/his marks in a row (coloumn or diagnal).

                Clone of the class Nokia snake game, the game that I enjoyed so much as a child. This game is also written in Python using Pygame
                library. Player controls the snake using the arrow keys to eat as much fruits as possible, while avoiding hitting on the wall or 
                the body of the snake.
